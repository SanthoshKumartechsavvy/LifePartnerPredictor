      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>We believe that love is a beautiful mystery waiting to unfold. Our journey began with a simple question: “What if we could predict who our life partner would be?” <br />Inspired by the serendipitous encounters and unexpected connections that shape our lives, we set out to create a fun and whimsical tool that adds a touch of magic to the quest for love.</p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to sprinkle a little randomness into your search for a life partner. We don’t take ourselves too seriously, but we do take love seriously. Whether you’re curious, skeptical, or simply looking for a laugh, our predictor is here to entertain and delight.</p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Randomness Magic</span> : Our secret sauce lies in the mystical blend of stardust, unicorn tears, and a dash of chaos theory. When you click that “Predict” button, our magical algorithm swirls the cosmic particles and reveals your potential life partner.</li>
        <li><span>Share the Laughter</span> : Share your results with friends, family, or your cat. Who knows? Maybe your cat will find their purr-fect match too.</li>
        <li><span>Disclaimer</span> : Remember, this is all in good fun! It predicts by randomly generated values. Take it with a pinch of glitter.</li>
      </ul>
